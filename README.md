# Triox - a cloud server for the next generation

**A free file hosting server that focuses on speed, reliability and security.**

## Why Triox?

☘️ **Open Source** - We strongly believe in collaboration and transparency.

⚡ **Speed** - Get the most out of your hardware! Triox runs fast, even on weak hardware.

🔒 **Security** - We're using state-of-the-art algorithms and authentication methods to protect your data.

⛓️ **Reliability** - Built on top of the strong guarantees of the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org).

🛫 **Easy Setup** - Triox comes with batteries included and is easy to configure.

🔬 **Modern Technologies** - Authentication with [JWT](https://jwt.io) and a front-end based on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

## Features

Triox is still in an early stage but is already usable. The features we'd like to add before our first release can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/AaronErhardt/Triox/issues/17).

## Demo servers

Sign in with username `demo_user` and password `demo_password`.

Sadly, we can't allow users to upload files due to legal restrictions. Since we can't guarantee that no illegal data will be uploaded the demo servers run in read-only mode.

- US server: [triox-demo.aaron-erhardt.de](https://triox-demo.aaron-erhardt.de)
- EU server: [triox-demo-eu.aaron-erhardt.de](https://triox-demo-eu.aaron-erhardt.de)

# Setup

+ Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
+ Install dependencies:
  - pkg-config, common package name: `pkg-config`
  - OpenSSL, common package name: `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`
  - MySQL-client, common package name: `libmysqlclient-dev`, `libmariadb-dev-compat` or `mysql-devel`
+ Install a MySQL-server such as mariadb, common package name: `mariadb-server`
+ Setup database (more below)
+ [optional] setup SSL certificate for HTTPS

Now you should be ready to go! Use `cargo run` to compile and start the server.

## Database setup

### Creating database user

```sql
CREATE DATABASE triox;
CREATE USER 'triox'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON triox.* TO 'triox'@localhost;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Install diesel client

```bash
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features mysql
```

### Add .env for diesel client

```bash
echo DATABASE_URL=mysql://triox:password@localhost/triox > .env
```

### Run migrations

```bash
diesel migration run
```


## SSL setup

### Generating SSL key and certificate

```bash
cd ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
cd ..
```

Then update `config/local.toml`:
```toml
[ssl]
enabled = true
```
